# SolarSpy
## An SMS monitoring service for a solar farm powered by Raspberry Pi Pico W.

### What Is It?
The project collects data from a solar panel using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and processes that data to get readings such as average voltage and UV index. That data is then sent via SMS to a phone number for easy monitoring. This could be extrapolated to use over many solar panels to collect readings and get easy updates from the state of the solar farm. We hope to continue working on this product in our spare time and keep enhancing its features!

### Why Was it Made?
Solay Spy was created for the first inagural Electrical Engineering Competition at the University of Alberta! The competition gave teams 10 hours and few constraints to make something fantastic to present to a panel of industry judges. Once our team saw a solar panel there, we immediately thought that this could be something interesting and built a project around it!ðŸŒž

### Future Improvements Include:
- Send a message to the pico to prompt for data
- Inclusion of an LCD display in the event that SMS is not available
- Increased accuracy in reading as well as more readings to take
