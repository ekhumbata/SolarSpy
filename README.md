### What Is It?
Solay Spy was created for the first inagural Electrical Engineering Competition at the University of Alberta. The project collects data from a solar panel using a Raspberry Pi Pico W and processes that data to get readings such as average voltage and UV index. That data is then sent via SMS to a phone number for easy monitoring.

### Future Improvements
- Send a message to the pico to prompt for data
- Inclusion of an LCD display in the event that SMS is not available
- Increased accuracy in reading as well as more readings to take
